What is this?
-------------

This tool let you determine a single 8 bit (256 colors) palette
for use with a bunch of images that has different palettes. 
Also, it lets you edit the palette before apply them, 
or convert several images to a palette that you already have.

How does it works?
------------------

It takes a bunch of images, loads them, and scan every pixel
to count the times of use of that color.
After that, It sorts the colors most used, takes the most 256
used colors, and then, converts each image to that new palette.

Why?
----

I made this program because a big storm burned my modem (and TV, and VCR, 
and fax, etc), and I need a program to do this and has I can't download it,
I made it for myself for my Linux box.
Also, it seems that there isn't a open source tool for Linux that could do this.
I made it thinking on portability, so I don't use any weird optimization.
For that, the program is a bit slow, but the results are pretty good,
at least with the images that I tested it (a lot of them, in fact, I'm
using this tool on my new games that I'm making right now).
The source code is a little mess because I was in a hurry.

--Added in 2007
Note that this tool was done back when true color was not 
the norm in games, is a bit dated for the current days,
but well, there is people still using 8bpp, and that is good :P.
I really don't use this tool anymore, because I moved
to code true color games, but I enjoy retro gaming too.

Instructions of use
-------------------

The program takes has parameter the files to convert.

$ kfixpal [image(s)]

You can use, for example (the $ represents your command line, don't put it)

$ kfixpal *.pcx

Or

$ kfixpal image1.pcx image2.pcx

When you load the images, you will see a dialog of configuration
where you put certaint parameters to improve the conversion.
The parameters are:

"Color Reduction"
This is for reducing the very similar colors (thus letting space for
other colors that the other images can have).
This gives the "distance" RGB where the color is considereg equal to another
and counted as it. For example, if you put "1" here, a color of 0,0,0 and 0,0,1
will be counted as the same color.
If you put "0", the colors will be treated all as unique colors.
Use big values when you have lots of similar colors (and want to loose some
detail), and use lower values for keep the color details.
Use small values when you have images with few colors each one.
I often use a value of 1 or 2
The values range from 0 to 63. 
Try several times with different values to get the desired effect.

"Read Area"
This is for when you use very big and smooth images that has
big zones of the same or similar color (like a big texture, or landscape
from top view, etc).
When counts colours, the inner loop takes pixels every X,Y value.
With a value of 1,1, it will take in count all the pixels of the image.
You should always let it on X+= 1 and Y += 1, but for big images with
very similar colours, you could put a value of 2, or more.
The results may vary very much if you change this values.
The values must be >= 1

"Custom Palette from file"
This is if you already have a image with a palette that you want to
use instead of calculating the palette.
Press the "..." button to browse for the file.
If you fill the field with a correct image, the other parameters will be ignored.

"Edit palette before apply"
If you let this checked, after the count of colours you will have the option
to edit each single color of the palette to fine tune your output palette.

When you done with this, press the "START" button to continue.
Then, the counting of colours and making of the palette will start (if you
put a custom palette, this will be skipped)

If you checked the "Edit palette" you will see a dialog where you can
edit the generated palette.
The dialog has a colour picker for choose the colour to edit.
Click on it to change the selected colour.
The dialog has 3 sliders for adjust the RGB values of the selected colour.
The button "OK" accepts the palette and goes on.
The "Re-configure" button takes you back to reconfigure the parameters
previously mentioned. This is useful to play with the values until you find
a palette that suits your needs.

After this, the conversion will take place, and the program will exit.

*VERY IMPORTANT* The input files will be overwritten, this mean that the new
converted file will be saved OVER the original file!!
Always make backups before using this!!! <- I MEAN IT! DO IT!

Tips 'n tricks
--------------

- ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR IMAGES BEFORE START THE CONVERSION!

- REMEMBER THAT THE INPUT FILES ARE OVERWRITEN WITH THE OUTPUT FILES.

- I often use The GIMP first to reduce the images to a 256 or 128 palette,
  and then, I unify the palette using KFixpal.
  For this, I use the "Image -> Mode -> Indexed Colour" option, and
  then, I don't select dithering, and I use the "Optimun Palette" option.
  Sometimes, I even reduce the image to 32 or 64 colour, depending of
  what kind of image I'm using.
  
- Try to don't use dithering on your images for best effect conversion.

- Try to avoid gradients.

- When you design your images, try to stick to certain range of colours.

- When there is a electric storm, unplug your modem! 
  I give you this advice from first hand... :)

Thanks
------

Well, I should thank a lot of people, but as far as I remember right now...
- To my father and mother (my first 386!!)
- To F3N1X, for my copy of Linux!
- To the GNU guys, for those excellent software. (and way of life)
- In special, to all the people that work in/for/with Allegro, 
  the coolest library that I ever known... :^)
- For those about the rock we salute you!
- Bah... thanks to everybody!
